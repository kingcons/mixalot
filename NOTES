All streamers should provide implementations for these GFs. Then shuffletron should only rely on that as an exported API.
For shuffletron's purposes it is necessary to store and be able to access song-of and stopped info associated with each streamer. Currently there is a wrapper class that performs this action. Is there a reason these couldn't be part of a base-streamer class that also involved the ALL set of slots below?

all:
handle
sample-rate
output-rate
filename
length
position
seek-to

mp3:
buffer

flac:
buffer
channels
min-buffer-length
buffer-position

vorbis:
channels
io-buffer
convert-buffer

jukebox-streamer adds stopped and song-of slots.

It'd be nice to not have 8 different fucking systems in mixalot. Ideally at the end of the day we'd have 3 or 4 ffi libraries on github and corresponding mixalot libs that depend on them. There shouldn't be an independent mixalot lib as opposed to mixalot-mp3, mixalot-ogg, mixalot-flac unless it's a mixalot-everything lib. Stop the monolithism!
